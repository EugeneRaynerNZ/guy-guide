# What is diet?

![A Healthy diet, a healthy mind](/diet/green-leafy-mind.png)

## Why is diet so important?
The saying "you are what you eat" has got to be one of the most important statements ever. Say you eat McDonald's every night of the week. What do you think would happen to your physical and mental health? Both would steadily decline. 

Imagine you take control of your diet and eat the right vitamins and nutrients that your body needs. What would happen to your physical and mental health? You would have greatly increased energy, mood, and physical appearance.
