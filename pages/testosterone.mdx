Testosterone is a hormone found in humans. It's extremely important to have normal levels of testosterone in males.

## What does Testosterone do for men?

There are huge benefits to having 'normal' Testosterone levels in men.

### What are 'normal' levels of Testosterone?

The normal range for testosterone levels in adult men can vary slightly depending on the laboratory that performs the test, but in general, the range is between 300 to 1,000 ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter).

### How can I calculate 'normal' levels of Testosterone?

Get a blood test or buy a Testosterone test kit. If your score is on the lower end, you may notice more female characteristics. 

{/* For example, I have 'normal' levels of Testosterone but last time I got checked it was at 12.2 which is on the low end of the scale. I find it hard to gain muscle, concentrate, and sometimes lack passion / drive. I also gain fat around my hips and breasts. */}

Once you have your blood test results, you can visit a Testosterone calculator website such as:

### Too Low Testosterone

When testosterone levels are low, men may experience decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection. They may also experience fatigue, depression, decreased muscle mass and strength, and increased body fat.

Additionally, low testosterone levels can increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones and makes them more susceptible to fractures. It can also increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome.

### Too High Testosterone

Excess testosterone can lead to aggressive behavior, mood swings, and irritability. It can also cause acne, oily skin, and hair loss. High testosterone levels may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer, and can lead to testicular shrinkage and infertility.

In addition, high testosterone levels can also increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, particularly if accompanied by other risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.
