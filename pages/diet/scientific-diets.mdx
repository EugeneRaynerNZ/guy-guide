# Scientific Diets

There are plenty of diets online, but some are more scientific than others.

We have curated a list of scientific diets that have been proven time and time again to help with fat loss and improve mental health.

## List of scientific diets

### Low Carb Diets
- The Fast 800 diet: This diet is a low-calorie diet that aims to promote weight loss by restricting daily calorie intake to 800 calories per day
- The 5:2 diet: This diet involves eating normally for five days of the week and restricting calorie intake to 500-600 calories for the other two days.
- The Mediterranean diet: This diet emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. While it doesn't involve calorie counting, it's often associated with weight loss due to its emphasis on whole foods.
- The DASH diet: This diet emphasizes whole foods and encourages the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products. While it's not specifically designed for weight loss, it may promote weight loss due to its emphasis on healthy, nutrient-dense foods.
- The low-carb diet: This diet restricts the consumption of carbohydrates, with a focus on eating protein and healthy fats. While there are different variations of this diet, it may promote weight loss due to its restriction of calorie-dense carbohydrates.
- The Atkins diet: This diet is similar to the low-carb diet but focuses specifically on restricting carbohydrates. It involves several phases, with the initial phase involving a significant restriction of carbohydrates to promote weight loss.
- The ketogenic diet: This diet involves restricting carbohydrates and increasing fat intake to induce a state of ketosis, where the body burns fat for fuel. It's often associated with weight loss due to its restriction of carbohydrates and focus on healthy fats.
