# Protein

## Why is Protein important?

Protein is an essential macronutrient that plays a crucial role in men's diets. It helps build and repair muscles, supports immune function, and contributes to overall health and well-being. Men who engage in regular physical activity or strength training may require even more protein to support muscle growth and recovery.
